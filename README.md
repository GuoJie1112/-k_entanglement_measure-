# k_entanglement_measure Supplemental material for '$k$-entanglement measure without convex roof extension and its evaluation': A software of detecting $k$-entanglement for any states of qubits $\leq 4$.

**A software tool for detecting \$k\$-entanglement in qubit systems (\$n\leq 4\$).**

---

## 1. Software Overview

This software is specifically developed for detecting \$k\$-entanglement of quantum states involving 2-qubit, 3-qubit, or 4-qubit systems. It is designed to be simple to use and suitable for both research and educational purposes. The main functions include:

* Supporting **2-qubit**, **3-qubit**, and **4-qubit** quantum state analysis.
* Real-time detection of the separability (entanglement) of arbitrary quantum states.
* Displaying the detection results clearly, along with the corresponding computation time.

After loading the input state, the software automatically performs the evaluation and displays:

* **Detection Result**: Showing the separability or entanglement classification of the input state.
* **Elapsed Time**: Reporting how long the detection process took.

The software features a clean interface and intuitive operation, requiring no programming skills from the user.
